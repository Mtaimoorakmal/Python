# 📂 File Handling for Data Engineers (Python)

This repository contains **practical, real-world file handling scenarios** that a **Data Engineer** commonly faces while working with raw data.  
The focus is on **robust ingestion, validation, cleaning, and transformation** of files using **Python**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To practice and demonstrate:
- Reading messy real-world files
- Handling corrupted and inconsistent data
- Building reliable ingestion logic
- Preparing data for downstream analytics and pipelines

This is **interview-oriented** and **production-minded**, not just theory.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- Standard Libraries (`csv`, `json`, `os`, `glob`, `pathlib`)
- Jupyter Notebooks (for exploration)
- VS Code
